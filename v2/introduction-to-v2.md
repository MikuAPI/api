# Introduction to v2

{% hint style="info" %}
MikuAPI v2 is no longer usable when v3 will arrive! No data (images) will be returned from v2 after then.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The MikuAPI has been shutdown until v3 is completed, in an effort to respect content's creators and their work, because the API does not return any information about who made the art, and this is more than disrespectful.
{% endhint %}

v2 is the second major version of the MikuAPI, it introduced a new website and a standardized API versionning, the framework behind the API has been switched from [Fastify](https://fastify.io) to [AdonisJS v5](https://adonisjs.com).

## Technologies

MikuAPI v2 technologies are the following:

* AdonisJS v5
* TailwindCSS v2 (Integration to PostCSS/Webpack)
* PostgreSQL
* PM2
* Yarn

## Purposes

The purpose of v2 was to only return a random image of Hatsune Miku by reloading the page. The page's color was a dark-blue & white and was listing the contributors of the API. The website has been reworked to be more pleasing and in an effort to refer a bit more to Hatsune Miku's color.

Images were provided by DiamondLP.
