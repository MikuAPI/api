# After v3

## During development

During the development of v3, the whole project has been completely rewrote from zero and new technologies were adopted. In an effort to make MikuAPI open source, we also had to start from zero due to the original repository containing sensitive informations and was no good to show to the public. The v3's repository is a safe way for us to release the project to everyone.

It has been then decided to stop the API during development because of the missing copyright of the images. v3 is also fixing this problem. We will talk about it in the next weeks in a dedicated post.

You can learn about the new MikuAPI v3 technologies & changes [here](broken-reference).
