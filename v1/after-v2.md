# After v2

## During development

During the development of v2, a new techology has been decided to be used, and a new domain to be used. It has been decided to drop mikuapi.predeactor.net in favor of miku-for.us.

You can learn about the new MikuAPI v2 technologies & changes [here](broken-reference).

## After development & deployement of v2

After the development of MikuAPI v2 and the announcing that MikuAPI v1 will be deprecated, more than 30 days has been given to make the switch. Peoples who tried to use the v1 were automatically redirected to v2, if it was not a direct API call. (Referenced in [v1's endpoints](../v2/endpoints.md))

After that, the v1 of the API has been shutdown and the DNS record has been removed definitively.
