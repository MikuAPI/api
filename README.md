If you're using PM2 for running MikuAPI, you'll require PostgreSQL to work correcty, or manually edit `ecosystem.config.js`.
In development, the DB will be `mikuapi_dev`, in production, the DB will be `mikuapi`.

- Support for WindiCSS

We use WindiCSS for creating the frontend style. If you want to setup the autocompletion on your side, you need to do the following:

1. Install WindiCSS Intellisense extension: https://windicss.org/editors/vscode.html
2. Open commands, and use the command `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`, it will open a JSON file, it represent your settings.
3. At the bottom of this file, add the following lines to your JSON:

```json
"windicss.includeLanguages": {
  "edge": "html"
}
```

You should now be set!
